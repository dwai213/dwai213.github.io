**Software Intern JPL’s Mobility and Robotic Systems in Section 347, Pasadena, CA**		May 2013 – Aug 2015
<br>
*Mars Sample Transfer Testbed (MSTT) for Mars Sample Return and Comet Surface Sampling and Return (CSSR)*

- Primary Robotic 6 DOF Arm operator for MSTT on both SRL and Fetch Rover platform and responsible for demonstrating robustness in computer-vision assisted sample tube pick up in a broad spectrum of regolith
- Refurbished Pluto Fetch Rover by renovating mobility software based on a simple vehicle model as well as adding support for rotating rover in place as drive-by-joystick
- Incorporated collision detection software (Bullet) for non-convex geometries in workspace analysis software as a data-driven approach to inform the Sample Retrieval and Launch (SRL) rover design
- Developed C/C++ kinematic workspace analysis software to determine workspace accessibility for a 5 / 6 DOF robotic arm. Results from this work led the Mars Program Office to adopt an adaptive sample cache architecture

**Mechatronics Graduate Researcher with Professor Tomizuka, UC Berkeley**			May 2011 –Present

-	Applied optimal control in motion planning for robust precision tracking in free space optical communications
-	Developed software in Arduino and LabVIEW to manage a wireless sensor network for human motion tracking
-	Created and designed via Eagle various controller PCBs for Tailbot, a robot with inertial assisted control by an active tail inspired by lizards, which was a featured robot on the front page of Nature

**Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) Advisor, UC Berkeley**						May 2011 – Present

-	CEO for the nonprofit Pioneers in Engineering 501©3 Foundation, which promotes STEM education through an exciting, mentorship based process. Administrator for an annual scholarship for high school students
-	Organized the inaugural and well-received Robots vs Dinosaur Science Festival, a 100+ event, complete with 8 novel science activities in cooperation with Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, CA
