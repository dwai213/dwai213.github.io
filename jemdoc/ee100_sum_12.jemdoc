= EE100 Summer 2012

In Summer 2012, I was one of four teaching assistants, along with Jerry Chang, William Chow, and John Wang. Tony Dear was the instructor for the course.

Weekly, I taught two hour discussions as well as held two sessions of three hour long labs with two fellow assistants, Robert Tang Kong and Zoey Huang.

My responsibility included preparing for discussion and practice problems as well as getting familiar with the upcoming lab. In addition, I have to prepare homework\/exam solutions as well as hold public\/private office hours.

Having taken the course a little more than a year ago at the time, I had to relearn, and in some cases, learn (hi transistors) various topics.

My discussion notes are provided below:
