    <richText>Status update:&#xD;Continuing my work with the Mechanical Systems Control Lab, I worked over the summer in &lt;a href="http://ciber.berkeley.edu/"&gt;Center for Interdisciplinary Bio-Inspiration for Education and Research&lt;/a&gt; (CiBER) to create an upgraded version of the pre-existing &lt;a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6094658"&gt;Tailbot&lt;/a&gt; with pitch control. In addition to sporting a weighted carbon fiber tail with a off the shelf &lt;a href="http://www.losi.com/"&gt;Losi&lt;/a&gt; RC car as the chassis, the new Tailbot would have increased maneuverability compared to its predecessor. (i.e. turn left and right)&#xD;&#xD;As of now, I have finished the mechanical assembly for Losi Tailbot, which means the tail and its associated actuators are mounted and, when powered, will cause the tail to go through its range of motion. The next steps involve supplementing my robot with electronics to control the tail. Can&#x2019;t wait to see this project finish!</richText>
