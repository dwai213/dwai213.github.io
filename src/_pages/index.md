I am currently employed at <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> in the <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/">Robotics Section</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Paul_Backes/">Paul Backes</a>. When I am not working on robots, I enjoy playing the trombone and volunteering for <a href="https://pioneers.berkeley.edu">Pioneers in Engineering</a>.
