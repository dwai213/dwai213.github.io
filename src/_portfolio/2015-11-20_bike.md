Tellaride is an intelligent Bike Odometer system that [Jon Silberstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-silberstein-a7a98749), [Casey Duckering](https://cduck.me/), and I designed and built. It is a motion sensor that sits within a bike wheel and pairs with an iPhone app so that a biker can get realtime feedback on their bike ride. Computed kinematic quantities, like speed and altitude, are sent and saved on a cloud server. The biker can also formulate natural English queries on the iPhone that can then be reformulated as STL formulas and evaluated by a STL checker running on a cloud server.

The Bike Odometer is powered by a FRDM-K64F (shout out to [Andrew Chen](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L3R69A4?m=A211WH11UMLSSZ&ref_=v_sp_widget_detail_page) for his donation!) and has a [Pololu AltIMU-10 v4 9DOF chip](https://www.pololu.com/product/2470) for sensing and [Sparkfun BLE Mate 2 chip](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13019) for wireless communication.

The iPhone app allows the biker to input natural English queries like "Did I bike over 250 meters?". English queries are reformulated as STL formulas by a cloud server and then evaluated against the rider's record kinematic data.

	Once the inputted query becomes true (ex. Once you have biked 250 meters), the iPhone will display a pop up alert notifying the biker
