For the senior level design course, ME102b, I worked with Robert Luan, Stephen Chen, Jared Porter, and Ben Yee to design and fabricate a fleet of robots that, through computer vision, would arrange itself to form certain formations. Visual feedback information (orientation and position) is provided via [APRIL tags](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/wiki/index.php/AprilTags) and a potential function is used to avoid agent to agent collision.

On Demo Day, our project was voted the second best and was well received by many visitors.
To get a glimpse of what it was like, check out this short montage by Ben Yee that captured the day's events.
